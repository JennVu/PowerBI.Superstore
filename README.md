"Market Analysis

During the four-year study period, the company achieved total sales of 12.64M and a total profit of 1.47M. Sales, profit, and number of orders all showed an upward trend with sales increasing from 2.2M to 4.2M, profit increasing from 0.2M to 0.5M, and number of orders increasing from 4.4K to 8.5K, respectively. This is expected to continue in the future promising a bright future for the business as a whole

However, the average order value (AOV) experienced significant fluctuations during this period. In 2012, it hit its lowest point at $501 per order before recovering and then declining again to $504 per order. Despite this fluctuation, the company's average AOV was $505 per order, which is still higher than the AOV of the entire world sector expected in 2023 (about $493). This means that the company performed better than most of the competition serving the same market.

When looking at all the markets in which the company has set a presence, the APAC, EU, and the US were the largest markets with the most significant sales and profit. However, Canada proved to be the most effective market with the highest at 26.62%, while the EMEA market came last on the list with only 5.45%."
Product Analysis
In terms of total revenue and profit, the Technology category performed the best, making up 37.5% and 45.2% of the total respectively. Furniture and office supplies switched their rankings in terms of sales and profit. However, this trend did not hold true when viewed in the context of markets. For example, in Canada, office supplies accounted for the largest proportion of sales, yet performed the worst overall. Similarly, the table subcategory was seen as making a loss in general but was the most profitable in the Corporate customer segment in the same market.

RECOMMENDATIONS
"Potential market:
While Canada recorded the lowest sales among the 7 markets that the company presented, the market generated the highest profit rate, which allows the enterprise to have a rather generous budget for marketing and other market-growing activities. Moreover, the AOV in Canada is still under the AOV of the sector. That means there are chances for boosting sales there with plenty of ideas.
"
"Strategic products:
Strategic products should be defined after the decision of potential market since product performance and preference differ from market to market and the general trend cannot tell all,"
